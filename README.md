# VitalCircle – Predictive Chronic Care Ecosystem  

## 🚑 Problem Statement  
Current chronic care platforms are **reactive** and burden patients with manual logging while clinicians drown in raw data. Patients often don’t get predictive support until a crisis happens.  

**VitalCircle** solves this by providing:  
- **Predictive AI Stability Score** (forecasts health risks).  
- **Context-aware nudges** (personalized lifestyle suggestions).  
- **Clinician portal** (risk overview + suggested protocols).  
- **Dashboard** (visual health trends, goals, and progress).  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend**: Django + Django REST Framework  
- **AI**: webLLM with small quantized LLM (for predictions & nudges)  
- **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS + Recharts  
- **Database**: SQLite (demo), upgradeable to PostgreSQL  
- **Auth**: Django built-in authentication

## ✨ Features (Hackathon Build)  
- Patient dashboard with vitals input (BP, HR, stress, sodium intake).  
- **Stability Score Engine** → predicts risk % (rule-based + LLM).  
- AI-generated **nudges** for lifestyle support.  
- Clinician portal with patient risk list & suggested protocols.  
- Visual graphs for vitals & Stability Score trends.  
- (Optional) Community forum & gamified progress tracking.
